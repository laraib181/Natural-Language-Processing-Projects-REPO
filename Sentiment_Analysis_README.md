## Overview
This project focuses on **Sentiment Analysis** to determine whether product reviews carry a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning models, the system processes review text, extracts features, and classifies sentiments to provide valuable insights into customer opinions.

---

## Features
- Preprocessing of textual review data to remove noise.
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** and/or **Word Embeddings**.
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).
- Visual representation of sentiment distribution and model performance.
- Comparative analysis of different machine learning models.

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical computation.
- **NLTK / SpaCy** – Text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Scikit-learn** – Feature extraction (TF-IDF) and implementation of ML classifiers.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization of sentiment distribution and performance metrics.

## Techniques & Methodologies

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing ensures the raw text is clean and structured for analysis:
- **Text Cleaning** – Removal of punctuation, numbers, and symbols.
- **Lowercasing** – Standardizing text format.
- **Tokenization** – Splitting text into individual words.
- **Stopword Removal** – Filtering out common words (e.g., "the", "and") that carry little sentiment value.
- **Lemmatization** – Converting words to their root form to improve consistency.

---

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** Assigns weight to words based on their importance across the dataset.
- **Word Embeddings (optional):** Captures semantic meaning of words using vector representations (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

### 3. Sentiment Classification Models
#### Naive Bayes
- A probabilistic model based on Bayes’ theorem.
- Performs well on text classification due to word independence assumption.

#### Logistic Regression
- A linear model that predicts probabilities for sentiment categories.
- Effective for binary classification (positive vs negative) and can be extended to multi-class.

#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Finds optimal hyperplanes to separate sentiment classes.
- Known for handling high-dimensional text features effectively.

### 4. Model Comparison
| Model              | Strengths | Limitations |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Naive Bayes        | Fast, simple, works well with small datasets | Assumes word independence |
| Logistic Regression | Provides probability estimates, interpretable coefficients | Less effective on highly imbalanced data |
| SVM                | Handles high-dimensional data, strong performance | Computationally expensive for large datasets |

---

### 5. Evaluation Techniques
- **Confusion Matrix** – Shows correct vs incorrect predictions.
- **Accuracy Score** – Percentage of correctly classified reviews.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** – Measures model effectiveness in handling different classes.
- **Visualization** – Plots for sentiment distribution and model accuracy comparisons.

---

## Dataset
- Contains product reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.
- Preprocessing ensures quality and consistency before modeling.
- Data is split into training and testing sets for evaluation.

---

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone repository and install dependencies.
2. Place dataset in the appropriate directory.
3. Run analysis script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate results.
4. Visualize sentiment trends and classifier performance.

---

## Results
- Identified sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) with good accuracy.
- Visualization of sentiment distribution helped understand customer feedback trends.
- Comparative results showed model strengths and weaknesses through accuracy and confusion matrix plots.

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how NLP and ML techniques can effectively classify sentiments in product reviews. Insights derived from this analysis can improve customer experience, guide marketing strategies, and enhance product development.

---

## Future Improvements & Limitations
- Use deep learning techniques (LSTM, GRU, BERT) for context-aware sentiment classification.
- Explore ensemble methods combining multiple classifiers for better accuracy.
- Expand dataset to include multi-language sentiment analysis.
- Optimize preprocessing to handle slang, emojis, and domain-specific expressions.
